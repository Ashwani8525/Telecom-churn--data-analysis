# Telecom-churn--data-analysis
Analyzing the data of 51  USA state Telecom.


Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is an approach to analyze the data using visual techniques. It is used to discover trends, patterns, or to check assumptions with the help of statistical summary and graphical representations.

EDA helps us to:

1.Delve into the data set

2.Examine the relationships among the variables

3.Identify any interesting observation

4.Develop an initial idea of possible associations among the predictors and the target variable

A leading telecom firm wants to predict which customers are at high risk of churn to reduce customer churn. In this project, we will analyse customer-level data, build predictive models to identify customers at high risk of churn and identify the main indicators of churn.

The insights we have gained into the churn data set through the use of exploratory data analysis.

1.Customers with the International Plan tend to churn more frequently.

2.Customers with four or more customer service calls churn more than four times as often as do the other customers.

3.Churn rate increases with an increase in customer service calls.

4.There are some states where the churn rate is high as compared to others may be due to low network coverage.

5.Churn rate increases with an increase in customer service calls
